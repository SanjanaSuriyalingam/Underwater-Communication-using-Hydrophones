Underwater Communication Using HYDROPHONES

Overview:-

This project explores underwater communication between submarines using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The goal is to simulate the transmission and reception of messages, considering practical challenges in underwater environments.


Features :-

User Interaction: Users can input messages for transmission.

Encoding and Modulation: Messages are encoded and modulated for reliable underwater transmission.

Channel Simulation: A simulated channel introduces noise to mimic real-world underwater conditions.

Decoding and Verification: Received signals are decoded, and successful transmission is verified.

Visualization: Modulated and received signals are visualized for analysis.


Getting Started :-

Requirements:

MATLAB environment with required toolboxes.
Basic knowledge of underwater communication principles.

Usage:

Run the main script (underwater_communication_project.m) in MATLAB.

Follow on-screen prompts to input distance between submarines and messages.


Code Structure :-
underwater_communication_project.m: Main script orchestrating the entire communication process.


your_encoding_function.m: User-defined function for message encoding.

your_modulation_function.m: User-defined function for signal modulation.

simulate_channel.m: Function simulating the underwater channel with added noise.

your_decoding_function.m: User-defined function for message decoding.


Results :-
The project aims to demonstrate the challenges and solutions in underwater communication.


Analyze the visualizations to understand the impact of the underwater channel on signal transmission.


Acknowledgments :-

This project is for educational purposes and highlights the importance of addressing challenges in real-world underwater communication scenarios.
